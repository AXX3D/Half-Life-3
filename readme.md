## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
Musicbox'd

Musicbox’d is a website mockup inspired by Letterboxd, designed to showcase the concept of a music-focused cataloging and review platform. The mockup demonstrates how users could explore music releases, view profiles, and interact with ratings and comments in a visually structured web interface, without implementing real user authentication or live data processing.

Purpose of the Project

The purpose of Musicbox’d is to present a functional and visually coherent prototype that illustrates how a music catalog and social review website could operate. The project focuses on front-end design, layout, and user experience, allowing viewers to understand the platform’s intended features and interactions through predefined mock data and sample user accounts.

Key Components

The key components of the Musicbox’d mockup include:

Mock User Profiles displaying sample usernames, avatars, and activity summaries

Music Catalog Pages featuring predefined albums, artists, genres, release years, and cover artwork

Rating System that visually represents user ratings for music releases

Comment Sections showing sample user feedback and discussions

Navigation and Layout Components such as a homepage feed, music detail pages, and profile views

Technology Used and Implementation

Musicbox’d is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for basic interactivity such as dynamic rating displays and comment rendering. All data used in the mockup, including user accounts, music entries, ratings, and comments, is static or hard-coded and does not rely on a backend server or database. The project emphasizes front-end design principles, responsive layout, and usability to simulate the behavior of a full-featured music review platform.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. All HTML files must use index.html as the filename. Individual pages are distinguished through folder structure only.
2. Files must be placed in their respective folders based on their purpose.
  - Stylesheets in the css folder
  - Scripts in the js folder
  - Images and icons in the assets folder
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
